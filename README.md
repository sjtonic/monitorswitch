# Monitor Switch
Allows to switch between inputs of Dell U3223QE monitor on Linux platform. The standard 'ddcutil' doesn't work with the monitor and does not allow to switch inputs. I had to use 'ddcmonitor' application to investigate the issue and find a way to change an input.

This application/hack is partially based on the solution suggested by Ashark here https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/703048/how-do-i-run-a-sudo-command-from-kde-shortcuts-command
